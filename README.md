# Caesar-Cipher
Performs a Caesar Cipher encryption on a file and writes the contents to a new file.
The program will first ask you for an input file, which should contain the message that you wish to be encrypted.
The program will then ask you how many places you would like to shift the message.
This is how a caesar cipher encryption works. 
For example, if you had the message "hi" with a shift of 3, the output would be "kl"
Lastly, the program asks you where you would like to write the encrypted message to.

This is what the terminal will look like when it is run:

~/Documents/cryptoPy (master)
$ python caesarCipher.py     
What is the name of the file that you would like to encrypt?originalMessage.txt     
How much would you like to shift by?(0-26)5     
Where would you like to write the encrypted message?encrytpedMessage.txt


I have included a sample input and output file that used a shift of 5 to encrypt it.
